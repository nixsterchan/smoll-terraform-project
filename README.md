# Welcome to a smoll little Terraform project
The following mini project is one that I decided to start just to test out some of the basics I learnt from Terraform thus far. There are definitely lots of templates out there but I just wanted to try building a simple project based on stuff I learnt from a recent course I took! 

Be warned that this project is made by an absolute beginner and might invoke unpleasant symptoms such as the vomiting of bl**d. Viewer discretion is advised.
